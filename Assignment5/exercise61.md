In the second line we call add with 2, which is x, so now we have that the function f y = 2+y.
Line 3 then sets x to 77 but it it isn't used again in the previous function so x remains as 2. we then call addtwo with 5 which corresponds to f(5) = 2+5 which evals to 7.

The last one returns a closure. This is because y is undefined and we therefore need this to able to return an int. We instead get the closure of the last func.
